				  	<h1>Blue State Digital</h1>
						<p><a href="http://bluestatedigital.com" target="_blank">Blue State Digital</a> (BSD) is a digital marketing agency with offices spanning the east and west coasts and clients around the world. Shortly before I came to work at BSD in the summer of 2013, they underwent a major rebrand and website refresh. At the time, there was no marketing team so the rebrand was limited to the logo and website.</p>
						<p>The marketing team started off small, with myself and a couple of others to manage the projects. Once formed, we went to work creating all necessary marketing materials, and then some. We defined the overarching look for our social and email graphics, and created an icon library for general use and stylistic definitions for the creation of new ones. We also needed new templates for our Keynote decks and Pages documents as well as trainings to teach everyone how to use them. As our brand matured, we further evolved our website and digital graphics. Other projects within the marketing team included chalkboard art for our two D.C. office chalkboards and swag for employees, mostly consisting of apparel for company-wide events, such as our annual hackathons, and office-wide teams, such as jerseys for the D.C. softball team.</p>

				  	<h1>AirBSD</h1>
						<p>Every summer, Blue State Digital (BSD) hosts a company-wide hackathon where employees would come up with projects and form teams to complete those projects over the course of two days.</p>
						<p>One of the teams I was a part of came up with the idea to create our own version of Airbnb, aptly named AirBSD. With offices in London and five major U.S. cities, BSD offered monetary incentives to stay with other employees while visiting another office in order to help offset the costs of staying in a hotel. However, this incentive was rarely taken advantage of because itâ€™s easier to look up hotel rates than to reach out to an entire office to see if anyone has a spare bed or couch to crash on. AirBSD aimed to solve this problem by allowing employees to list their place along with details such as the how long commuting to the office takes, if they have any pets, and sleeping arrangements. It also provided an easy way for employees to get in touch with potential hosts with future plans to implement more sophisticated booking features such as an integrated calendar.</p>

				  	<h1>Indaba</h1>
						<p>Indaba is a collaborative survey platform that turns qualitative knowledge into quantitative data, such as the quality of education across a set of third world countries. It allows managers to set up surveys and timelines for those surveys to be filled out, reviewed, and revisited across a number of users. Once a survey is submitted, it is then passed on to an expert reviewer, who compares the information from each contributor and adds input. Finally, the knowledge from a collection of surveys is compiled and published into a data set, which can come in many forms, including maps, custom charts, and spreadsheets.</p>
						<p>Amida acquired Indaba in 2015, at which time it only had a handful of clients. We worked to completely rebrand and redo the platform in order to make it easy to use and introduce some much-needed features. Built on Bootstrap, the platform needed to be able to load quickly for those with slow internet connections and be flexible enough to accommodate a variety of languages, input types, and user needs.</p>

				  	<h1>Shatterproof</h1>
						<p><a href="http://shatterproof.org" target="_blank">Shatterproof</a> is a non-profit working to end the stigma around addiction and provide resources for the approximately 22 million Americans living with this disease. Blue State Digital worked with Shatterproof to launch a new website in 2013. As a newer organization, it was also important to spread their name and message, so we helped them drive their email and social campaigns, centered around both fund- and awareness-raising.</p>
						<p>As Shatterproof grew, we were able to direct our attention towards larger problems, such as getting the heroin overdose-reversing drug, Naloxone, into the hands of all first responders and getting viewers to write against Urban Outfitters for their new salon, Hairroin. Once Shatterproof's voice became a little louder, we could also begin to return to the root of ending the stigma: awareness. This came in the form of a variety of social and email strategy, as well as online quizzes and the <a href="http://www.shatterproof.org/we-are-shatterproof" target="_blank">#weareshatterproof</a> campaign, which created a platform for recovering addicts to share their stories and support one another.</p>

				  	<h1>UK Labour Party</h1>
						<p>During the 2015 UK elections, Blue State Digital worked closely with the Labour Party to strengthen their digital presence and online engagement. 2015 marked a landmark year for the Labour Party because it was the closest they had been to winning a majority vote in years.</p>
						<p>Blue State Digital helped to drive Labour's digital campaign by upping their social and email game, focusing on college-aged adults who the Labour Party would help the most but who are not typically known for being proactive voters. And because news can change by the minute during a political campaign (especially towards the end of one!), we needed to make graphics that werenâ€™t only awesome-looking, but easily templated and reused at a moment's notice. We also created single page applications and quizzes to help engage voters directly such as creating a leaderboard of schools with students registered to vote or getting voters to create a plan to vote.</p>

				  	<h1>YMCA of NYC</h1>
						<p><a href="http://www.ymcanyc.org/" target="_blank">The YMCA of New York City</a> has been a long-standing client at Blue State Digital, starting with a site redesign a few years back. More recently, our work was focused on revamping parts of their site to keep up with web standards and trends today.</p>
						<p>The YMCA wanted to rethink the experience on their hostels microsite. Before, it was hard to get the information most pertinent to booking such as where a hostel was located and who to get in contact with. They also wanted the chance to highlight the many great amenities that you wouldn't find at an average hotel or hostel, for instance access to the Y's facilities and cafes. We created a new microsite that included all of these features and were able to strike a balance between pushing the limits while sticking within their strict brand guidelines..</p>
